-- HVDF Client User Insights Pipeline Operation
-- pipeline: Recent number of views, purchases, etc for user
[{
  "$match": {
    "data.userId": "u123",
    "ts": {
      "$gt": 1516147200000
    }

  },

{ "$group": {
    "_id": "$data.type",
    "count": {
      "$sum": 1
    }

-- pipeline: Recent total sales for a user
[{

-- How to use user insights
There are, of course, many different things the results of these queries might tell us about our user’s behaviors.
For example, over time, we might see that the same user has viewed the same item multiple times, meaning we might
want to suggest that item to them the next time they visit our site. Similarly, we may find that a particular
item has had a surge in purchases due to a sale or ad campaign, meaning we might want to suggest it to users more
frequently to further drive up sales.

Up-selling is a big possibility here as well. For example, let’s say we know a user has looked at several different
low-end cell phones, but that in general their total purchases are relatively high. In this case, we might suggest
that they look at a higher-end device that is popular amongst users with similar stats.

-- Summarization
Performing user analytics, whether in real-time or incrementally, is no small task. Every step of the process from
capturing user data, to data storage, to data retrieval, to crunching the numbers present challenges that require
significant planning if the system is to perform well. Luckily, MongoDB and HVDF can be great tools for accomplishing
these types of tasks, either on their own or used in conjunction with other tools like Hadoop.
