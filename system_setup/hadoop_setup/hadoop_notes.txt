-- Hadoop Integration
For many applications, either using the aggregation framework for real-time data analytics, or the map-reduce function
for less frequent handling of large data sets in MongoDB are great options, but clearly, for complex number crunching
of truly massive datasets, Hadoop is going to be the tool of choice. For this reason, we have created a Hadoop
connector for MongoDB that makes processing data from a MongoDB cluster in Hadoop a much simpler task. Here are just
a few of the features:

Read/write from MongoDB or exported BSON
Integration with Pig, Spark, Hive, MapReduce and others
Works with Apache Hadoop, Cloudera CDH, Hortonworks HDP
Open source
Support for filtering with MongoDB queries, authentication, reading from replica set tags, and more

-- Install Hadoop 2.7.2
Download and install VMware Workstation 14 Payer
Download and install latest Ubuntu 64-bit on VMware Workstation
Extract Hadoop into hadoop-binaries directory
Install mongo-java-driver jar and mongo-hadoop-core.jar jar in the /share/hadoop/common directory
