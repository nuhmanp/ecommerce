This E-Commerce project shows how to use MongoDB, Spring and Spring Boot to develop an E-Commerce application. The application includes several fundamental E-Commerce components: Product Catalog Component and Inventory Management Component. MongoDB 3.4 is used to implement backend data domain model. The domain model is built on annotation based POJO classes. A sharded MongoDB cluster provides the storage for the product catelog data and inventory data. The product catalog contains more than 100000 products that are distributed on the two
MongoDB shards. MongoDB Java driver is used to access the product data and inventory data through MongoDB route server.
